## Week 2 Lab Exercise

#### Implementing a lexical analyser using C for recognizing the following tokens:
- 24 keywords
- Identifiers with the regular expression: `letter(letter | digit)*`
- Integers with the regular expression: `digit+`
- Relational operators: `<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=`
- Ignores everything between multi line comments `/* *** */`
- Storing identifiers in symbol table



The program reads input from a text file `x.txt` and writes output into a file `y.txt`
