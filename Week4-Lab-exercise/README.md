## Week 4 Lab Exercise

#### Implementing a lexical analyzer using LEX for recognizing the following tokens:
- A minimum of 10 keywords of any choice
- Identifiers with the regular expression `letter_(letter_ | digit)*`
- Signed as well as unsigned integers
- Signed as well as unsigned Floats in fractional as well as exponential notation.
- Relational operators `<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=`
- Assignment Operator `=`
- Ignores everything between comments: single line as well as multiline comments

- Using files for input and output.



The program accepts input file name as command line argument and writes output to `y.txt`
